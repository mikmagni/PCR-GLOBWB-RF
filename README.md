# PCR-GLOBWB-RF
Post-processing streamflow simulations from PCR-GLOBWB using random forest regression

## Introduction
Physical models of real-world variables are plagued by uncertainty in model components. A variety of methodologies exist that address this issue. 
Here, we correct streamflow simulations from global hydrological model PCR-GLOBWB using random forest regression.
Our innovation over other published research is that we use hydrological state variables from PCR-GLOBWB, in addition to meteorological input and catchment attributes, as predictors of observed discharge (response variable).
